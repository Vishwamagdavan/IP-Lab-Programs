        <p>Chennai district, formerly known as Madras district, is one of the 37 districts in the state of
            Tamil Nadu in India. It is the smallest and densest of all the districts in the state. Most of the
            Greater Chennai City comes under this district, erstwhile under Tiruvallur, Kanchipuram and 
            Chengalpattu districts. As of 2011, the district had a population of 8,653,521 with a sex-ratio of
            989 females for every 1,000 males.
            Chennai is a megacity and local government district that contains the historic centre and the
            Central business district (CBD) of Chennai metropolitan area. It constituted most of Chennai
            from its settlement by the peoples in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the city has
            since grown much since then. The city forms a small part of the metropolis of Chennai, though it
            remains a notable part of central Chennai metropolitan area.
            In 2018, the district limits were expanded, aligning with that of the newly formed Greater
            Chennai Corporation, which resulted in the area being increased from 178 square kilometres (69
            sq mi) to 426 square kilometres (164 sq mi).The district has three revenue divisions and ten
            taluks.</p></div>
